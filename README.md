## Abstract
Transmitting images for communication on social networks has become routine, which is helpful for covert communication. The traditional steganography algorithm is unable to successfully convey secret information since the social network channel will perform lossy operations on images, such as JPEG compression. Previous studies tried to solve this problem by enhancing the robustness or making the cover adapt to the channel processing. In this study, we proposed a robust image steganography method against lossy JPEG compression based on embedding domain selection and adaptive error correction. To improve anti-steganalysis performance, the embedding domain is selected adaptively. To increase robustness and lessen the impact on anti-steganalysis performance, the error correction capacity of the error correction code is adaptively adjusted to eliminate redundancy. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better anti-steganalysis and robustness.

## 摘要
在社交网络上传输图像以进行通信已成为常规，这有助于隐蔽通信。 传统的隐写术算法无法成功传达秘密信息，因为社会网络通道将对图像进行有损操作，例如 JPEG 压缩。 之前的研究试图通过增强鲁棒性或使覆盖适应通道处理来解决这个问题。 在这项研究中，我们提出了一种基于嵌入域选择和自适应纠错的鲁棒图像隐写术来对抗有损 JPEG 压缩。为了提高反隐写分析性能，选择了嵌入域自适应地。 增加鲁棒性并减少对反隐写分析的影响性能，自适应地调整纠错码的纠错能力以消除冗余。 实验结果表明所提出的方法实现了更好的反隐写分析和鲁棒性。
