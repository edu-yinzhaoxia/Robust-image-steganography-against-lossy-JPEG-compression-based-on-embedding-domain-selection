DESCRIPTION

    The  program extracts  274 merged extended DCT and Markov  features from all
    JPEG images  residing in a given  directory. The  features are exported in a
    row by row  manner. At  the end of each row, the name of the processed image
    is printed. Program exports both original version of the features introduced
    in [1] (274 features) and  its  improved version - Cartesian calibrated fea-
    tures introduced in [2] (548 features).
    
    Before you  start, make  sure  you  compile  both 'DCT.c' and  'IDCT.c' pro-
    grams  using the MATLAB's mex command.  You will also need to  compile  Phil
    Sallee's jpeg_read.c function. For  your  convenience, in  our sourcecode we
    enclose a few precompiled  versions of jpeg_read function  working on diffe-
    rent  platforms. In  case none of  these precompiled  versions works on your
    platform,  you  need to  compile it on your own. In  that case,  you need to
    download Phil Sallee's JPEG toolbox sourcecodes from this location:
    
    http://www.sqrtpi.com/Software/jpegtbx_1.4.tar.gz
    
    as well as the jpeglib library which Phil Sallee uses:
    
    ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz. 
    
    The main function is  BatchMergedFeatures(dir), taking only one  parameter -
    the path to the  directory containing the JPEG images. The output files with
    the features will be  generated at the  location 'data/merged.fea' (274) and
    'data/cc-merged.fea' (548) within the same directory. We include five sample
    JPEG images  with the expected  features so you can verify that the  program
    works properly on your machine. These  testing  images are  located in  the
    subdirectory 'test', and theirfeatures are stored in the files
	
	'test/data/expected-merged.fea'
	'test/data/expected-cc-merged.fea'
	
    You can use the enclosed file test.m for this verification. Please, contact
    the authors in case of any problems/comments you might have.
